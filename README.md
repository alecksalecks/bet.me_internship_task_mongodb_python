# bet.me_internship_task_mongodb_python
An internship task (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0YJSHD_yYEhBscTeH3-DcPdG1S2nt08/view?usp=sharing) for an application to bet.me, making use of Python and MongoDB to request betting data using the-odds-api and storing it into a database.
Feedback included (but was not limited to) :

    A random number generator was used to add delays, rather than fixing the scheduling,
    There were a number of print statements where a logging package would have been a better choice.
    The API response was parsed in a slightly odd way. The code could have stored all bookmaker odds in one object.
